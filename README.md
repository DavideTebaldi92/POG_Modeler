# POG_Modeler
This repository contains the main files to run the POG_Modeler program. Specifically, this repository contains the following files:
- POG_Modeler_23a.p: the POG Modeler program. It is a Matlab coded file. The suffix ” 23a” of the program name indicates the first Matlab version which can run the program.
- How_to_Use_POG_Modeler: this file describes the basic rules for using the POG Modeler program.
- POG_Modeler_Manual.pdf: file containing a basic version of the POG Modeler Manual.
- Help_POG.m: this file contains the low-level ascii commands of the POG Modeler program.
- SIMSCAPE_Basic_Blocks.slx: a Simulink file containing the Simscape blocks that can be used to define the structure of the physical systems to be converted in the POG environment.
- POG_Congruent_Transformation.m: Matlab function performing a state space congruent transformation.
- POG_Input_Output_Inversion.m: Matlab function performing a state space input-output inversion.
- SI_Units: file containing the System International Units.

This repository also contains the following directories:
- POG_Examples. This directory contains some examples of physical systems. Each example is a ”txt” file containing the POG structure of a physical system.
- SIMSCAPE_Examples. A few Simscape examples of physical systems. Each example is a ”slx” file containing the Simscape structure of a physical system.
